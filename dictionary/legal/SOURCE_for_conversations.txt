I extracted text from these files (which contain transcribed phone conversations) and put them in one file.
I also modified them (no punctuation or anything else just words plus removed people's names and corrected some typos, most notably the context is also altered!)

Couldn't find any info about the license but I guess they are open since they are on GitHub.
